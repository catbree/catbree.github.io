        <p>Have you ever looked at the spine of a library book and wondered how its call number was decided? Lucky for me, it was mentioned during work by a colleague of mine which led me into a small search on what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p><img src="/images/dewey-book-spine.jpeg" alt="Library Books using DDS by mercycountylibrary.blogspot.com"></p>
<h2 id="whats-a-dewey-decimal-system">What&rsquo;s a Dewey Decimal System?</h2>
<p>The Dewey Decimal System (DDS) is a popular classification system used to arranged books and was created by Melvil Dewey in 1851.</p>
<p><img src="/images/melvil-dewey.jpeg" alt="Melvil Dewey"></p>
<p>In the past, books were organised chronologically in terms of when they were first added to the library. This resulted in browsing difficulties as books weren&rsquo;t ordered in a way that made sense to readers. With the introduction of the DDS, books were organised based on their subject and placed along with other similar books.</p>
<p>Pretty cool, no? :3</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>A book&rsquo;s call number is made up of three main sets of information and arranged in numerical &amp; alphabetical order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first three digits informs the <strong>class</strong>.</li>
<li>The next three digits following the decimal informs the <strong>division</strong>.</li>
<li>The three letters at the end informs the <strong>author</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the DDS scheme, there are 10 classes in total, each covering a large subject with an assigned code as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/dewey-decimal-system-class.png" alt="Dewey System Classes"></p>
<p>By design, the classification structure is hierarchical. Each digit to the right indicates a more specific topic of the preceding digit&rsquo;s topic. As such, books can be generalised if the numbers on the right are removed. Similarly, using more digits would indicate a more specific topic.</p>
<p>This example taken directly off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification">Wikipedia</a> which was very helpful to showcase the idea above:</p>
<pre><code>500 Natural sciences and mathematics
    510 Mathematics
        516 Geometry
            516.3 Analytic geometries
                516.37 Metric differential geometries
                    516.375 Finsler geometry
</code></pre><p>As additional examples, here are the call numbers of some books I&rsquo;ve recently read.</p>
<ul>
<li>530.0922 MLO - <a href="https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=1&amp;BRN=204518160">Stephen Hawking: A Memoir of Friendship and Physics</a></li>
<li>363.738747 GAT - <a href="https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/WPAC/BIBENQ/261602175/334933159,3">How to Avoid a Climate Disaster</a></li>
<li>158 KIS - <a href="https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/WPAC/BIBENQ/261626113/269028461,5">The Courage to be Disliked</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bias">Bias</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning the system&rsquo;s flaws as well. The original DDS has been criticised to be racially biased. Not too long ago, LGTBQ+ topics have been parked under the categories such as Derangement and Abnormal Psychology. This situation has slowly evolved positively over time, with LGBTQ+ topics being housed more appropriated under 306.76. <a href="https://overland.org.au/2015/07/a-brief-history-of-homophobia-in-dewey-decimal-classification/">A Brief History of Homophobia in Dewey Decimal Classsification</a> is an article that covers more details around DDS' racial biasness which is worth a read.</p>
<p>Other flaws include skewing towards christianity and away from women. While I won&rsquo;t be touching on these too much, it seemed like something I should acknowledge along with this article.</p>
<h2 id="random-thoughts">Random thoughts</h2>
<p>The DDS system has been revised through 23 major editions with the most recent version printed in 2011. While I haven&rsquo;t looked specifically into the specific changes over the years, I believe that there would be a correlation that reflects the world&rsquo;s focus during the time of change.</p>
<p>Additionally, I think it&rsquo;s pretty cool to see a real-world information architecture being used by so many in the world. It would be one my go-to examples when content hierarchy is mentioned in the future.</p>
