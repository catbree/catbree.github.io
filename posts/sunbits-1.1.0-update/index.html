        <p>It&rsquo;s been awhile.</p>
<h2 id="im-back-after-an-unplanned-hiatus">I&rsquo;m back after an unplanned hiatus.</h2>
<p>When Sunbits was first created, I envisioned it to be a consistently updated living journal of my learnings and progress. If you look at my past posts.. well.. it didn&rsquo;t turn out that way.</p>
<p>What started off as a new adventure quickly turned into something that I dreaded. My experiences didn&rsquo;t feel worthy for the internet. Writing was also difficult, it felt impossible to express something in my head through pictures and words.</p>
<p>I struggled badly.</p>
<p>But not too long ago, I read a short and sweet book called <a href="https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/"><em>Show Your Work</em> by Austin Cleon</a>. He summarised the book with these 10 points:</p>
<p><img src="/images/sunbits-1.1.0-update-show-your-work.jpeg" alt="Show Your Work"></p>
<p>Since this isn&rsquo;t a book review, I won&rsquo;t get into the details. But I&rsquo;ve decided to take some of his advices (as well as ignore some others kek). I created this cozy little corner so I could carve out a little space of the internet for myself. It may take awhile and it may be in short snippets, but I&rsquo;m back so <strong>hello again!</strong></p>
<h2 id="110-updates-to-sunbits">1.1.0 Updates to Sunbits</h2>
<p>Okay, enough with the feels. I made some updates to my blog.</p>
<h3 id="videos-and-gifs">Videos and Gifs</h3>
<p>My posts are written in Hugo in Markdown so I hadn&rsquo;t been able to post videos. In my second post, <a href="/posts/spotify-fan-study">Spotify&rsquo;s Fan Study</a>, I realised a need for it when I was trying to show an interaction but couldn&rsquo;t do it. ðŸ˜¢ It uses a <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/">shortcode</a> which I learnt from <a href="https://iamsorush.com/posts/add-video-to-hugo-post/">this post by Sorush Khajepor</a>.</p>
<p>As a demonstration, here&rsquo;s a gif of a game that I&rsquo;m currently obsessed with.</p>

<h3 id="about-page">About page</h3>
<p>I also added a new page. To be honest, there&rsquo;s really no use-case for it except for my urge to show anyone this cute drawing I did of Rabbit holding a sunflower. Yes, the white syrian hamster is called <em>Rabbit</em>.</p>
<p>You can navigate to it using the main navigation bar. But for the lazy, <a href="/about">here you go</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sunbits-logo-animation">Sunbits logo animation</h3>
<p>Last but not least, a completely unnecessary update to animate the Sunbits icon. Because, why the heck not? I&rsquo;d love to show a code snippet, except code blocks aren&rsquo;t styled yet.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the last part of this post.</p>
<h2 id="moving-forward-from-here">Moving forward from here</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll focus on writing shorter and more informal posts to reduce the amount of effort it takes to get a post out. At this point, I&rsquo;d like to get comfortable with publishing something of my own, rather than perfecting a piece that never gets to see the light of day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to use a library for code blocks. I found a library called highlight.js but am still in the process of figuring out how it works.</p>
<p>Happy days ahead!</p>
