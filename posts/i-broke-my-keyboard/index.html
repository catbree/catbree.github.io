        <p>and then I got a new one. It&rsquo;s been a rollercoaster ride.</p>
<h2 id="sunbits-project-update">Sunbits Project update</h2>
<p>So in Jan I wrote about <a href="/posts/sunbits-project-2022">Sunbits Project 2022</a> which was an experiment to work on my personal interests which refreshes every month for the sake of exploration and testing. As you can guess from the title, I spent the last 3 months learning how to mod my keyboard.</p>
<p>The original plan of a 1-month stint quickly grew out of proportion because of a mistake I made a year ago (to be explained later).</p>
<p>This is a quick summary on the journey so far, but it won&rsquo;t be technical or academic of any sorts. Because while I&rsquo;ve been enjoying this and adopted it as a side-hobby, I&rsquo;d like to close out this chapter in order to start a new Sunbits Project!</p>
<h2 id="so-what-did-i-do-for-the-past-three-months">So what did I do for the past three months?</h2>
<p>With zero knowledge of keyboard modding, it wasn&rsquo;t immediately obvious just how big of a opportunity/mistake this was. For the unfamiliar, a hot-swappable keyboard allows you to quickly remove switches from its plate and PCB using a switch puller. This is much easier than the painstaking labourous process of desoldering your switches piece by piece. Attached a picture for reference!</p>

<p>At the time of purchase, I purchased the model that wasn&rsquo;t hot-swappable. As a result, I spent the first month of so gathering the tools and learning how to deconstruct my keyboard.</p>
<p>There were a lot of things I did and learnt during that period. Here&rsquo;s an extremely rough note I did when in the first month:</p>
<p><img src="/images/keyboard-mod-notion-notes.png" alt="Keyboard Mod Notes"></p>
<p>I made a lot of mistakes and addressed them along the way. Until I made an irreversible error - I burnt the circuit tracks on my PCB. This caused an entire row of keys to malfunction. After multiple futile attempts at resolving the issue, a kind internet stranger offered to look into it for me. We couldn&rsquo;t figure out where the burnt track was and couldn&rsquo;t repair it. With a very heavy heart I said goodbye to Keebs and decommissioned it.</p>
<p>On the bright side, I learnt a great deal about keyboards. At this point, I&rsquo;ve done so much additional work that customising my new keyboard was pretty much a breeze. I&rsquo;m currently using a 65% with stock Gateron Brown switches desoldered from Keebs while waiting for my new switches to come. Maybe I&rsquo;ll post my build in the future!</p>
<h2 id="minor-value-adding">Minor value-adding</h2>
<p>If someone who&rsquo;s new to keyboard modding approached me, this would be the two things I&rsquo;d say. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re written on the internet. Except I missed it and learnt it the hard way.</p>
<h3 id="1-always-test-your-pcb-first-always">1. Always test your PCB first. Always.</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s normal for bad wiring and soldering jobs to occur even for manufactured PCBs. Whenever you have a blank PCB, always test it first before you invest the time and effort that comes after. I only found this article after I soldered all my switches back into a PCB unbeknownst that I had already broke it. Had I checked beforehand (it&rsquo;s alright, I didn&rsquo;t know), I could have saved a whole set of hand-lubed switches as well as the insane number of hours soldering/desolder/lubing.</p>
<h3 id="2-theres-no-such-thing-as-an-endgame-keyboard">2. There&rsquo;s no such thing as an endgame keyboard.</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the fun to experiment and mess things up. Don&rsquo;t spend too much effort looking into making the perfect first build. It doesn&rsquo;t exist - not at the first try. The easiest way is to find some of the things that you&rsquo;re comfortable with and simply start. You&rsquo;ll figure things out along the way. Hmm, actually this seems like solid life advice in general, no?</p>
<h2 id="was-it-worth-it">Was it worth it?</h2>
<h3 id="key-moments">Key Moments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wallet has less money than before. Has anyone ever mentioned how expensive this hobby is?</li>
<li>A non-working Keebs who has taken up the new management role of watching me while I work now that it&rsquo;s retired.</li>
<li>Gave the first set of switches (milky yellows) I&rsquo;ve ever lubed to my colleague who refers to it as the (I kid you not) <strong>wubalubadubdub</strong>.</li>
<li>Broke my keyboard&hellip;</li>
<li>Which gave me an excuse to build a new keyboard - Beebs.</li>
<li>And spend more money.</li>
<li>Became the keyboard &ldquo;verties and hories guy&rdquo; in the eyes of my brother and Sam. I&rsquo;ve linked the video below, check it out it&rsquo;s pretty funny.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="verdict">Verdict</h3>
<p>Yes. Very much so. I&rsquo;m glad I made my big mistake. I&rsquo;d do it all over again.</p>
<h2 id="where-now">Where now?</h2>
<p>I should get better at documentation. But that&rsquo;s it for this article. I made an instagram post so that I can share videos and images here. If it works, you&rsquo;ll see it below. (:</p>
<p>At the moment, I&rsquo;m waiting for the parts to upgrade Beebs. A friend&rsquo;s birthday is also coming up and I&rsquo;ll be building a keyboard for them as a present. Let&rsquo;s hope said friend isn&rsquo;t reading this!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now. Toodles!</p>
