<h2 id="happy-2022">Happy 2022!</h2>
<p>I had a recent bout of identity crisis sometime back in Dec 2021. It opened up a pandora&rsquo;s box that took a lot of time and effort to grapple with. With the help of many kind individuals that I&rsquo;m surrounded with (and very grateful for), I&rsquo;ve managed to have a bit more understanding about what I am now and what I will work towards. It&rsquo;s not much and I still feel too vulnerable to share it with the world, but I hope it&rsquo;ll appear here someday.</p>
<p>Amongst a set of themes that I&rsquo;ve set for 2022, one of them is <strong>Growth ðŸŒ±</strong>. A lot of things change every year, but this theme has stayed consistent through my life (which I&rsquo;m also grateful for). That being said, of course it&rsquo;s easier said than done. :p Which brings me to introduce <strong>Sunbits Project</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="sunbits-project">Sunbits Project</h2>
<p><em>This is the name. I haven&rsquo;t thought much about it, I don&rsquo;t think I will.</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inspired by <a href="https://benstokes.dev/">Ben Stokes</a> who created <a href="https://benstokes.dev/">Tiny Projects</a>. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know much about Ben&rsquo;s real job work but I&rsquo;ve been following his tiny project adventures ever since Mailoji (~ sometime in Mar 2021).</p>
<p>His words perfectly summarises how I feel around this so I&rsquo;ll just leave it here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably like you, I&rsquo;m that person who is constantly coming up with lots of little project ideas. Whether that be ideas for apps, websites, games, businesses; whatever. I have them all stored on a list in my phone, and I know you probably have one of those lists too.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem is I never seem to get round to completing them, or even starting them for that matter. The list just grows bigger and bigger.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Not completing any of these ideas comes with a few problems: The list grows bigger and more daunting. I feel like a failure because I&rsquo;m not completing anything. Missing out on exploring cool ideas with massive potential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tiny Projects is a way for Ben to explore his ideas quickly at low stakes. It initially started out as a weekly thing, but time proved to be a major factor so the projects come out a lot slower now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have an exact 1-1 problem fit to this. But here&rsquo;s a quick thing I wanted to share with you that led me to think about starting Sunbits Project.</p>
<h2 id="have-i-told-you-about-rain-light">Have I told you about Rain Light?</h2>
<p>I started a mini personal project sometime in Oct 2021. I&rsquo;ve always loved the rain. There&rsquo;s something about it that makes me feel a certain jolly way. Except I work in a room with frosted windows and I&rsquo;m often in calls with my headsets on so I always miss the rain.</p>
<p><img src="/images/sunbits-project-convo-with-melvin.jpg" alt="A Conversation with a Friend"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make a desk lamp that lights up when it&rsquo;s raining so I know it&rsquo;s time to open the windows
~ Famous last words by Yours Truly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TLDR; it kind of worked, but it also mostly didn&rsquo;t. Most importantly, I got tired of working on it so I stopped.</p>
<p>I found an API for my <a href="https://data.gov.sg/dataset/realtime-weather-readings?resource_id=8bd37e06-cdd7-4ca4-9ad8-5754eb70a33d">location&rsquo;s realtime rainfall</a>. The mini program makes a call to the API every 5 minutes to check if there&rsquo;s any rain recorded at the weather stations near where I lived. I bought random parts on the internet, mistook a bluetooth controller for a wifi module, and made all sorts of mistakes in between. I cobbled up a simple Arduino device and tested it and all that shit.</p>
<p>The final concoction was a mini mushroom light that lit up when it rained. Which also sometimes lit up when it didn&rsquo;t. and at some point I believe it has made up its own mind to light up whenever it feels like it.</p>
<p>I have a video of it somewhere in my old phone which fell to its death when I went cycling in the rain (hah). I&rsquo;ll add it here if I ever recover it.</p>
<p>{placeholder of mushy by the window}</p>
<h2 id="it-was-fun-then-it-wasnt">It was fun, then it wasn&rsquo;t.</h2>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to put this project to an end. When I attempted to fix something, something else happened. Each problem was huge to me, every single thing was new. It was a huge step - followed by a huge step - followed by another huge step.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had tons of fun exploring and building it. But towards the end, I was simply exhausted.</p>
<p>I felt like a failure.</p>
<p>Then the (unrelated) identity crisis came.</p>
<p>And I was eventually forced to stop when I simply couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to continue anymore.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-think-sunbits-project-would-help">Why I think Sunbits Project would help</h2>
<p>Sunbits Project serves as a set of rules and boundaries that will help me pace my personal project interests. I&rsquo;d like to create an environment and mindset for myself to learn and create while leaning in to the failures and unforeseen outcomes that come along with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to share my vulnerabilities and discomforts more openly.</p>
<p>Ideally, the time specificity lets my projects be a form of catharsis which stops itself the moment it stops being cathartic to work on.</p>
<h2 id="sunbit-project-rules">Sunbit Project Rules</h2>
<p>This is mostly for personal accountability. But here&rsquo;s the following rules to the Sunbits Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>I start a new project every month. The first one being in February.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll write a post at the end of the month as a form of completion.</li>
<li>Completion is simply defined as the final documentation of a project regardless of its state.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m free to give up and fail. I&rsquo;ll report as such and move on.</li>
<li>Projects cannot extend past the month. When the month is over, I essentially stop-drop-roll and start a new one.</li>
<li>(I do foresee a situation of wanting to further continue a project, I&rsquo;ll think about that situation and optimise for it only when it comes.)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/sunbits-project-stop-drop-roll.png" alt="Stop Drop Roll"></p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll stop right here before anxiety catches up to me and I decide against posting this! For the record, I&rsquo;m extremely excited to start on my new projects.</p>
<p>Toodles and Happy 2022!</p>
<h3 id="270122-update">27/01/22 Update:</h3>
<p>I watched a video that was very in-line with this blog post and thought I&rsquo;d share it. It&rsquo;s about Mark and his journey towards creating a fully-functioning MVP game in 30 days. Spoiler: He made it! And it&rsquo;s such an inspiration of what a properly planned project can actually look like.</p>
