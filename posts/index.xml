      <description>Happy 2022! I had a recent bout of identity crisis sometime back in Dec 2021. It opened up a pandora&amp;rsquo;s box that took a lot of time and effort to grapple with. With the help of many kind individuals that I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded with (and very grateful for), I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to have a bit more understanding about what I am now and what I will work towards.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been awhile.
I&amp;rsquo;m back after an unplanned hiatus. When Sunbits was first created, I envisioned it to be a consistently updated living journal of my learnings and progress. If you look at my past posts.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across Spotify&amp;rsquo;s Fan Study the other day - it shared a set of data-driven insights about the behaviours of Spotify Users and how artists can act upon them. I found it interesting and thought I&amp;rsquo;d share a short reflection piece about this website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
