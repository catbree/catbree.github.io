    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I came across Spotify&rsquo;s Fan Study the other day - it shared a set of data-driven insights about the behaviours of Spotify Users and how artists can act upon them. I found it interesting and thought I&rsquo;d share a short reflection piece about this website.</p>
<p><img src="/images/spotify-fan-study-thumbnail.png" alt="Image by Spotify via "></p>
<p>There are numerous advocates for <a href="https://ux.shopify.com/in-defence-of-boring-ux-ad32acd4d437">boring UX</a> nowadays — a lot of work lies behind the curtains for for us to deliver simple and straightforward content to our users. I do agree largely with this view, though sometimes it&rsquo;s cathartic to stumble upon a website that challenges this notion while  still satisfying a need and being useful.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-fan-study-by-spotify">What is Fan Study by Spotify?</h2>
<p>The Spotify team has always been pretty well-known for their marketing stunts. This <a href="https://fanstudy.byspotify.com/">Fan Study</a> was published on 20 May 2021 for Spotify artists. It released 15 key insights backed by data-driven research and touched on how fans (Spotify&rsquo;s way of calling everyday listeners like you and me) listen to music and connect with their favourite artists. With each insight, there was a clear CTA - an actionable step that artists can take to grow their fanbase.</p>
<p>Immediately, it was very clear what the site&rsquo;s purpose is and who it was for.</p>
<p><img src="/images/spotify-fan-study-target.png" alt="Spotify&rsquo;s Fan Study Target Audience"></p>
<h2 id="notables">Notables</h2>
<h3 id="clear-structure">Clear Structure</h3>
<p>Right off the bat, the website kept repeating: 15 insights, segmented into four themes. Clear signposts and transitions were around to let users know when they&rsquo;re finishing a theme and entering another one. Almost no getting lost here!</p>
<p>There is also a really clear flow, which can be summarised in this way: Index → Specific Insight → Don&rsquo;t believe? View data. → Actionable step.</p>
<p>For a Spotify artist, the site&rsquo;s usefulness comes from: gaining newfound insights backed by evidence, and acquiring useful tools to build their fanbase.</p>
<h3 id="the-primary-button-wants-you-to-click-it">The primary button wants you to click it.</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen all sorts of primary buttons&hellip; solid ones, glowing ones, moving ones, flashing ones, but have you seen one that literally follows you across the screen? Well, maybe- but it&rsquo;s been long since I&rsquo;ve experience one unironically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please click me. — primary button probably</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/spotify-fan-study-primary-button.png" alt="Primary button"></p>
<h3 id="abstract-patterns-i-didnt-get">Abstract patterns I didn&rsquo;t get</h3>
<p>The animations are smooth (on desktop) and satisfying as they morphed across the screen while I scrolled through the insights. But even though they piqued my interest, I didn&rsquo;t understand them. I made no connections with the abstract patterns, even though it was a key element of the website.</p>

<p>What am I supposed to make out of this illustration&hellip;?</p>
<h3 id="navigation-wasnt-immediately-visible">Navigation wasn&rsquo;t immediately visible</h3>
<p>While I was looking through the content, I wondered why there were no other methods of navigation apart from a manual scroll. Towards the end of my adventure, I found an inconspicuous dominoes icon at the top. It made sense after I clicked it, except its shape and animation looked very much like a sound wave. Not to mention, it only appears when I scroll up.</p>
<p><img src="/images/spotify-fan-study-navigation.png" alt="Where is navigation?"></p>
<h3 id="awkward-and-choppy-mobiletablet-interactions">Awkward and choppy mobile/tablet interactions</h3>
<p>The Fan Study was highly responsive, with a lot of rearrangements done to ensure that it would look good on almost any platform. But the website proved to be a challenge to load on mobile, and the interactions were choppy.</p>
<p>You may also recall the CLICK ME button - what happens to that on mobile you ask? Well, it disappeared. Since there isn&rsquo;t a cursor to follow, it just shows as a normal button on smaller screens.</p>
<p>(a small thought in my mind - wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun if it was replaced by a slow-moving button that bounces around within the clickable area? like a bubble!)</p>
<h2 id="why-i-wrote-this-website-highlight">Why I wrote this Website Highlight</h2>
<p>I enjoyed the balance of aesthetics and usability on this website. Despite some unconventional elements and over-the-top design, its clear IA and flow kept the website structured and straightforward to understand. It serves as a reminder to think outside of the box while still coming up with something that&rsquo;s highly usable and addresses the primary needs of our users. I hope to have a collection of similar websites that make me feel a certain way and come back to them in the future when my creative juices are lacking.</p>
